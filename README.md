# Deep Learning Graph Reader

The Deep Learning Graph Reader is a powerful tool that leverages machine learning to convert various types of graphs, including bar charts, scatter plots, and more, into structured data tables. This program utilizes a combination of a Large Language Model (BERT) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently extract valuable insights from graphical representations.

## Features

- Converts diverse graph types into organized data tables.
- Utilizes BERT for natural language understanding of textual elements within graphs.
- Employs a CNN for accurate visual feature extraction and interpretation of graphical elements.
- Streamlines the process of data extraction from research papers, reports, and presentations.
- Provides an efficient solution for converting complex visuals into usable and structured formats.
